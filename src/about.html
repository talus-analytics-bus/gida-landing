        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>
          The Infectious Disease Events and Analysis platform is a comprehensive
          collection of datasets, visualization dashboards, decision support
          tools, and research sites developed by the Georgetown University
          Center for Global Health Science and Security. The suite of tools is
          custom designed and built to support broadscale research efforts to
          promote health security globally, with a specific focus on the
          intersection between global health, economics, policy, legal
          epidemiology, and security. This work has been presented at the United
          Nations Biological Weapons Convention Meeting of Experts, published in
          the academic literature, served as the basis for policy
          recommendations within the United States federal government, used to
          support and inform state and local preparedness and response efforts,
          and driven coordination and implementation efforts in global
          governance.
        </p>
        <p>
          These tools are built on an integrated data architecture that supports
          robust analysis between datasets and designed for continual expansion
          and cross-disciplinary quantitative and qualitative analysis. Drawing
          from a wide range of fields, this work builds on expertise across the
          Center and draws from methods in computational modeling, legal and
          policy research, geospatial analysis, systems analysis and
          architecture, and data visualization.
